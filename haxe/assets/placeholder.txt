GMX Assets Directory

This directory contains assets for the GMX application.
Currently serves as a placeholder to resolve the Heaps.io resource system requirement.

Assets that may be added here include:
- Images (.png, .jpg)
- Fonts (.ttf, .fnt)
- Audio files (.wav, .ogg)
- Data files (.json, .xml)

The Heaps.io framework automatically scans this directory and makes assets available
through the hxd.Res class.
