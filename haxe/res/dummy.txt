This is a dummy resource file to satisfy the Heaps.io resource system requirements.

The Heaps.io framework expects at least one file in the assets directory
to properly initialize the resource system, especially when using the
@:build(hxd.res.FileTree.build()) macro.

This file can be removed once proper game assets are added to the project.
