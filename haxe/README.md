# GMX Application - Haxe/HashLink Port

This is a modern port of the GMX application from Adobe AIR/Flash to Haxe using the HashLink runtime. This migration follows the successful approach used by Shiro Games for titles like Northgard, providing better performance, cross-platform compatibility, and future-proofing.

## Migration Overview

### From Adobe AIR to Haxe/HashLink

The original GMX application was built using:
- Adobe AIR runtime
- ActionScript 3.0
- Flex/MXML for UI
- Flash graphics and display objects

The new port uses:
- HashLink VM for native performance
- Haxe programming language
- Heaps.io game engine for graphics and UI
- Cross-platform deployment capabilities

### Key Benefits

1. **Performance**: HashLink provides near-native performance compared to Flash's interpreted execution
2. **Cross-Platform**: Deploy to Windows, Linux, macOS, and potentially mobile platforms
3. **Modern Toolchain**: Active development and community support
4. **Future-Proof**: No dependency on deprecated Flash technology
5. **Smaller Memory Footprint**: More efficient memory usage than Flash/AIR

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Haxe Compiler** (version 4.3.0 or higher)
   ```bash
   # Download from https://haxe.org/download/
   ```

2. **HashLink VM** (version 1.13 or higher)
   ```bash
   # Download from https://hashlink.haxe.org/
   ```

3. **Node.js** (version 14.0.0 or higher) - for build scripts
   ```bash
   # Download from https://nodejs.org/
   ```

### Platform-Specific Requirements

## Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd gmx/haxe-port

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Haxe libraries and setup build directory
npm run setup
```

### 2. Build the Application

#### Development Build
```bash
npm run build
```

Or for development with auto-rebuild:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Run Flatpak Package
```bash
flatpak run com.gmx.Application
```

## Architecture Comparison

### Original Flash/AIR Architecture
```
Main.mxml (Flex Application)
├── GMXMain.as (Canvas Container)
├── PopUpManager (Flash)
├── GMXBuilder.as
└── Services/
    └── ControlChannel.as
```

### New Haxe/HashLink Architecture

## Key Migration Changes

### 1. Display System
- **Before**: Flash Display Objects, MovieClips, Sprites
- **After**: Heaps.io Objects, Graphics, Bitmaps

### 2. UI Framework
- **Before**: Flex containers (VBox, HBox, Canvas)
- **After**: Heaps Flow layout system

### 3. Event System
- **Before**: Flash Event system with addEventListener
- **After**: Heaps Interactive objects with direct callbacks

### 4. Networking
- **Before**: Flash Socket and URLLoader
- **After**: Haxe sys.net.Socket with proper error handling

### 5. XML Processing
