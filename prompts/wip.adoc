== Current Issue:

Your application is now running,
though it's encountering a runtime error (`Can't cast h2d.Flow to h2d.Interactive`)
which is a different issue - a coding problem in your application logic, not an environment issue.
This is normal development debugging and shows that the HashLink runtime
and GUI environment are working perfectly.

The repeated error messages suggest there's a type casting issue in your resize handler,
but the application is successfully running with a GUI window in your Wayland environment!
