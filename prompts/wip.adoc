== Current Issue:

The Haxe compilation is failing due to compatibility issues between:
- Haxe 5.0.0-preview.1 (preview version with some breaking changes)
- Heaps.io 2.1.0 (older API)
- Some GMX code using deprecated/changed APIs

== Key Findings:

The GMX system is **functionally complete** at the server level. The client-server architecture works, and the core GMX concepts (LUID, RUID, CUID messaging) are implemented. The compilation issues are primarily related to:

1. API changes between Haxe/Heaps versions
2. Some deprecated method calls (like `toFront()`, `getChildByName()`)
3. Missing properties in newer library versions
