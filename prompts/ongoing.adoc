== Does GMX work?

The system demonstrates that:
* The GMX architecture migration from Flash/ActionScript to Haxe/HashLink is viable.
* The core functionality is working.

The asciidoc files do not follow covention.
* The blocks use markdown syntax instead of asciidoc syntax.
* The lists should get a single preceeding blank line.
* The lines of text should be ventilated.
