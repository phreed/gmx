= GMX - Graphical Message eXchange

GMX is a client-server application framework for building dynamic, data-driven user interfaces. The GMX client is a Flash/ActionScript application that connects to servers providing layout definitions and data content.

== Architecture Overview

GMX follows a client-server architecture where:

* *GMX Client* - A Flash/ActionScript application that renders dynamic UIs
* *Layout Server* - Provides UI layout definitions via XML messages
* *Data Server* - Provides content as records and collections of records

== Core Concepts

=== GUID System
GMX uses three types of globally unique identifiers (GUIDs):

* *LUID* (Layout Unique ID) - Identifies layout components and containers
* *RUID* (Record Unique ID) - Identifies individual data records
* *CUID* (Collection Unique ID) - Identifies collections of related records

=== Message Types
* *Layout Messages* - XML-based UI definitions targeting specific LUIDs
* *Record Messages* - Data updates for individual records (RUIDs)
* *Collection Messages* - Batch operations on groups of records (CUIDs)

== Quick Start

=== Client Development
See link:docs/developer_guide.asciidoc[Developer's Guide] for:
* Building and deploying the GMX client
* Creating custom UI components
* Debugging and testing

=== Server Development
See link:docs/server_guide.asciidoc[Server Guide] for:
* Implementing layout servers
* Implementing data servers
* Message protocols and formats

=== Examples
The link:examples/[examples directory] contains:
* Sample layouts (`examples/layouts/`)
* Sample records (`examples/records/`)
* Sample collections (`examples/collections/`)
* Reference server implementations (`examples/servers/`)
