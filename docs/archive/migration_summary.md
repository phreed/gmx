# GMX Application - Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the successful migration of the GMX application from Adobe AIR/Flash to Haxe/HashLink, following the proven approach used by Shiro Games for titles like Northgard.

## Migration Completed

### âœ… Core Infrastructure
- **Main Application Structure**: Migrated from `Main.mxml` + `GMXMain.as` to `Main.hx` + `GMXApplication.hx`
- **Display System**: Replaced Flash Display Objects with Heaps.io Objects and Graphics
- **Event System**: Converted from Flash events to Heaps.io Interactive callbacks
- **Runtime**: Migrated from Adobe AIR to HashLink VM for better performance

### âœ… Data Models
All ActionScript Value Objects have been converted to Haxe classes with full XML serialization compatibility:

| Original (AS3) | New (Haxe) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `FieldVO.as` | `FieldVO.hx` | âœ… Complete |
| `RecordVO.as` | `RecordVO.hx` | âœ… Complete |
| `CollectionVO.as` | `CollectionVO.hx` | âœ… Complete |
| `RuidVO.as` | `RuidVO.hx` | âœ… Complete |
