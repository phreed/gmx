<p>GMXBuilder has 4 areas of interest (from left to right):
  <b><u>1) XML Text Area</u></b>
	Contains the XML used for building components in the Build Area.  You can change the text manually and then rebuild it by either clicking the "UPDATE LAYOUT"  Button or pressing SHIFT + ENTER.  Note that until you initiate the rebuild in this way, the XML has not been updated even though you may have changed the text in the XML Text Area.  This may be of concern if you make a change that initiates rebuilding elsewhere (e.g. editing an attribute--see below), because the text will revert to what it was at the last rebuild (along with whatever change was made by whatever initiated the rebuild, of course).<br/>
GMX uses the same mechanism it uses to process the XML payload of a Layout message to process the XML in this Text Area.  Hence, you can simply copy and paste the XML from the text area into an XML file for the Layout Manager to use.
  <b><u>2) Build Area (a Canvas)</u></b>
	This contains everything that was built from the XML in the XML Text Area.  The components in this area will respond exactly as they would if a Layout message had been sent to create them (e.g. they can send / receive messages if they have ruids and fids).
	Additionally, when you click on a component, it is highlighted and the Attribute Editing Area (see below) is updated with that particular component\'s available attributes so that you may edit them.<br/>\t\tComponents in the Build Area can be dragged around by [holding SHIFT + mouse press + drag].  Their x & y attributes are updated accordingly in the XML.  <i><b>Note</b> that even though the x & y attributes of a component are set, the component will NOT be placed using absolute position if it is contained in an HBox or VBox.  If you want absolute positioning, use a Canvas component!  You can, however, rearrange the components <b>within</b> a VBox or HBox by dragging them to before or after other components in those containers.</i>
You may delete a selected component using [hold CTRL + hold SHIFT + DELETE]
  <b><u>3) Attribute Editing Area</u></b>
After clicking a component in the Build Area, this area is populated with editable components for all of the available attributes for that component (i.e. CheckBoxes for Booleans, ComboBoxes for Enums, & TextInputs for everything else).  After changing an attribute\'s value, the XML in the Text Area will be updated everything will be rebuilt in the Build Area.
	If you wish to <i><u>remove</u></i> that attribute from the XML:
<ul><li><i>CheckBox</i>: Hold either CTRL, SHIFT, or ALT and click the Check Box</li><li><i>ComboBox</i>: Select the blank option</li><li><i>TextInput</i>: Delete all the text and then either press ENTER or change focus (both actions cause an update to occur)</li></ul>
  <b><u>4) Add Component Button Area</u></b>
	The label on these Buttons indicates which component they create.  When clicked, that component will be added as a child of the currently selected component.  Depending on the component added, it will have some default attributes as well as children components and/or fields.  If no component is selected, the new component is added to the Build Area VBox which is the top level. 
	Some items at the top of this Add Component Button Area are special:
<ul><li><i>SEND Record Button</i>: Allows you to simulate an external service sending an ISISRecord message to GMX.  In the window that pops up, either select an existing ruid or type in your own, then type in the number of fields you want to send and press ENTER.  Places for the fields pop up, and you can either choose from fids that already have been instantiated in GMX or send new ones.</li><li><i>SEND Collection Button</i>: Like the Send Record button but for Collections</li><li><i>send file text box</i>: hover over the text box with the mouse to get a tooltip explaining more.</li><li><i>EDIT FIELDS Button</i>: When a MultiField component (which have "field" children--e.g. a Dial) is selected and this button is pressed, a Table with all these field children pops up.  You can add new field children to them (Create Entry), or edit existing field in the table.  Press (Update XML) to apply the changes you have made to the field children.</li></ul>
