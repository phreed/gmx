= Layout Examples

This directory contains XML layout message examples that demonstrate how to create and modify GMX user interface components.

== Files

=== Basic Layout Messages

==== `basic_layout_message.xml`
A comprehensive example showing a complete layout message with:

* Parent container with LUID
* HBox containers with nested components
* Button with dual labels
* ComboBox with collection reference
* Label with static text
* AttitudeIndicator with field mappings

This example demonstrates the fundamental structure of GMX layout messages and shows how components are organized in a hierarchical tree structure.

==== `layout_replacement_message.xml`
Demonstrates layout tree pruning and replacement by targeting a specific LUID (`hbox2`). This shows how to:

* Replace part of an existing layout tree
* Use LUIDs to target specific layout nodes
* Modify layouts without recreating the entire interface

==== `attitude_indicator_with_values.xml`
Shows how to set field values directly in layout messages:

* Setting initial values for component fields
* Mapping field IDs to field names with values
* Understanding the trade-off between convenience and data retention

=== Layout Manager Files

==== `layout_manager_main.xml`
Example of a Layout Manager configuration file demonstrating:

* XInclude usage for modular layout composition
* Dimensional specifications (width/height in mm)
* Background color settings
* Nested container structures (VBox, HBox)
* Referenced layout files through href attributes

==== `manifest.csv`
Layout Manager manifest file example showing:

* Base layout file specification
* File reference mapping (logical name to physical path)
* Comment syntax
* File organization structure

==== `initialData.csv`
Initial data population file for Layout Manager demonstrating:

* CUID (Collection Unique ID) definitions
* RUID (Record Unique ID) definitions with field values
* Hierarchical data organization
* Shortcut command embedding in data
* CSV format for data specification

== Usage

These examples can be used as:

1. **Templates** for creating new layout messages
2. **Reference** for understanding GMX layout syntax
3. **Test data** for GMX client development
4. **Documentation** for layout message structure
